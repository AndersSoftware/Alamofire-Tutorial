# Alamofire Swift Tutorial: Build Robust iOS Networking with Less Code
A complete, production-ready iOS networking implementation using Alamofire, demonstrating modern Swift development patterns, secure authentication, and enterprise-grade error handling.
## üì± Features
Complete API Manager - Singleton pattern with automatic authentication and retry logic

Secure Token Storage - iOS Keychain integration for encrypted credential management

Smart Retry Logic - Automatic retry with exponential backoff for server errors

Request Interceptors - Automatic Bearer token injection for authenticated requests

Thread-Safe Operations - Actor-based attempt tracking for concurrent requests

Structured Error Handling - Comprehensive error types for better debugging

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
This project implements enterprise-grade networking patterns with security-first design and maintainable code organization.

Key Components

KeychainHelper: Secure storage service for authentication tokens and sensitive data

APIManager: Centralized networking layer with automatic authentication and retry logic

RequestInterceptor: Automatic request modification for headers and authentication

RequestAttemptTracker: Thread-safe retry attempt management using Swift actors

APIError: Structured error handling with specific error types and status codes
